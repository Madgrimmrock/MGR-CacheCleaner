A small, automated, RedM Server Cache cleaner

How to:
1. Place the file on your server's desktop.
2. Edit the file and replace: "SET HERE YOUR SERVER CACHE PATCH e.g. C:\redm-server\txData\RexshackRedMBuild_E8BF90.base\cache" with the path to your RedM server cache.
3. and save as *all files NOT as .txt
4. Run the file, and the program will automatically clear your server cache.

Enjoy!

WARNING: Your files (Cache) will be deleted!
